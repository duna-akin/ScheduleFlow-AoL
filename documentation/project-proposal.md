# Tour Guide Scheduling Automation - Project Proposal

## Lafayette College Office of Admissions | Ambassadors of Lafayette

### Summary

Proposed automation system to streamline tour guide scheduling and communication processes for the Lafayette College Admissions Ambassadors of Lafayette program.

### Current Challenges

- Manual scheduling process is time-intensive
- Risk of human error in assignments
- Complex coordination of multiple tour guides
- Time-consuming manual Slack notifications
- Difficulty tracking guide availability
- Difficulty assuring even distribution of tour guide workload

### Proposed Solution

Develop an automated system that will:

1. Process tour guide availability from already utilized Excel spreadsheets
2. Match available guides with family/visitor demand
3. Generate optimized daily/weekly schedules
4. Automatically send formatted Slack notifications via a Slack-Bot integration
5. Handle special assignments (co-tours, evaluations)

### Technical Implementation

- Python-based scheduling engine
- Excel/CSV data processing
- Slack API integration with a Slack-Bot
- Possible Slate integration (pending approval)

### Benefits

- Improved accuracy in assignments
- Enhanced communication efficiency
- Better utilization of guide availability
- Reduced administrative overhead

### Resource Requirements

- Development time: 3-5 weeks
- Testing period: 2 weeks
- Technical resources:
  - Server/computer for running scripts
  - Slack workspace access
  - Python development environment
  - Excel/CSV processing capabilities

### Success Metrics
